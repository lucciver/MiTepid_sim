Simulating stratified model for the spread of COVID19 in a population, Made in Tuebingen. 

As the famous saying goes: "all mathematical models are wrong, some are useful". I hope this is one of the useful ones.
There is an abundance of mathematical models of various degrees of sophistication to model the spread of a disease in a population. But the common problem in using these models in real-world applications is that it is very difficult to come up with meaningful values for parameters of such models. The below mentioned manuscript exlpains the theoretical basis of the results. The method allows us to tune the parameter of the model in a country or pouplation based on the real-world data of the spread of COVID-91 in another. Its strength and weaknesses are explained in the manuscript. The main strength is that we can evaulate different containment strategies based on various stratifications of the population, in particular the age groups.
